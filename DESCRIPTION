Title: Interpolated Stacked Bar Plots with ggplot2
Version: 0.1.0
Author: William Kumler
Maintainer: William Kumler <wkumler@uw.edu>
Description: This geom interpolates smoothly between the values that would normally be 
    provided to geom_bar using a sigmoid curve.Often, this is useful when a 
    stacked bar plot is desired but the values along the perpindicular axis are 
    numeric rather than discrete. A numeric axis often results in overplotting 
    or weird spacing issues when the data could instead be interpolated and 
    show up more nicely.
